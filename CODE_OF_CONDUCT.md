# 🏴‍☠️ The Pirate's Code of Conduct

## 🦜 Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, and leaders of the **Parrot Booty Protection** fleet pledge to make participation in our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive, and healthy community of shipmates.

## ⚔️ Our Standards: The Code of the Sea

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment for our fleet include:

*   **Showing Empathy**: Treating all shipmates with kindness and respect.
*   **Respecting Opinions**: Being mindful of differing viewpoints and experiences.
*   **Constructive Feedback**: Giving and gracefully accepting feedback on the rigging.
*   **Taking Responsibility**: Apologizing for mistakes and learning from them.
*   **The Greater Good**: Focusing on what's best for the overall security of the fleet.

Examples of unacceptable behavior (Scallywag activities) include:

*   **Sexualized Language**: Use of sexualized language or imagery of any kind.
*   **Trolling**: Insulting, derogatory comments, or personal/political attacks.
*   **Harassment**: Public or private harassment of any shipmate.
*   **Doxing**: Publishing others' private information without explicit permission.
*   **Inappropriate Conduct**: Any behavior that would be considered unprofessional on the high seas.

## ⚓ Enforcement Responsibilities

The fleet's leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

Leaders have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code, and will communicate reasons for moderation decisions when appropriate.

## 📡 Scope

This Code applies within all community spaces (the deck, the crow's nest, and the war room), and also applies when an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces.

## 📜 Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported to the fleet's leaders. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

All leaders are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the reporter of any incident.
