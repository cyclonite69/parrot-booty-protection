# 🏴‍☠️ Security Policy: Protecting the Fortress

We take the security of your "booty" seriously. If you've found a way to scuttle our defenses, we want to know before the privateers do.

## 🛡️ Defended Versions

Only the latest rigging is fully supported with security updates.

| Version | Supported          |

## 🦜 Reporting a Vulnerability: Bounty Hunting

If you discover a hole in the hull or a weakness in the rigging, please follow these steps to report it responsibly:

1.  **Do NOT sound the public alarm.** Opening a public issue alerts the scoundrels before we can patch the leak.
2.  **Send a carrier pigeon (Email).** Contact the maintainers directly with a detailed description of the vulnerability.
3.  **Show us the map.** Include clear steps to reproduce the issue so we can verify the weakness.
4.  **Wait for the signal.** We will acknowledge your report within 48 hours and work with you to secure the fortress.

## ⚓ The Pirate's Code of Disclosure

We are committed to fixing security vulnerabilities as quickly as possible. We ask that you give us a reasonable amount of time to deploy a patch before you disclose the vulnerability to the public. 

*“May your code be clean and your treasure stay hidden.”* 🦜🏴‍☠️
